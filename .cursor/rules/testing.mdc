# Testing: Minitest + Capybara

- Test layout: [test/*](mdc:test), fixtures in [test/fixtures/*](mdc:test/fixtures)
- System tests: Use Capybara for end-to-end flows; driver configured via `selenium-webdriver` 4.26.0.
- Controllers/models: Follow patterns in existing tests under [test/controllers/*](mdc:test/controllers) and [test/models/*](mdc:test/models).
- CI: For coverage and CI integration, gems live in `:ci` group (`minitest-ci`, `simplecov`).
- Seeds/fixtures: Prefer fixtures; avoid depending on `db/seeds.rb` for tests. Keep tests deterministic.
